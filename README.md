# FreeCodeCamp Curriculum Projects
---
This repository simply contains the projects I made as I studied through the 'curriculum' offered on FreeCodeCamp's website. The curriculum is a series of guided projects which teach about various stages of software development right from frontend through to backend, deploymeny, machine learning, and data science. I just wanted to keep these projects on record so I am updating them here.
